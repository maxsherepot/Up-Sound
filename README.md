## About Up-Sound
Project with Node.js, Express and MongoDB as back-end, and React &amp; Redux as front-end
Here you can discover some great music albums, view the details of each one, listen to them on Spotify or YouTube Music, add to the list of your favorite albums.
The program was developed as a home project in February - March 2021. 

In the future, it is planned to gradually expand the functionality and increase the number of albums.
Here I first developed the server part creating a full-stack project.

At the front end of the project, I used React and Redux.
Additionally, react-loader-spinner, react-paginate, react-toastify, redux-thunk, and other npm modules were installed.
Javascript library axios was used to support requests, receive responses from the server, transform and automatically convert them to JSON.

The back end part is made using Node.js.
Additionally, Express and MongoDB technologies were also used.
Authorization has also been implemented, thanks to which each registered user receives his unique collection of favorite albums.
